## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By building this project, I solidified my knowledge of basic CSS and learned how to center a div using: 

```css
 {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
Also, I applied my knowledge of making an image responsive by using:
```css
 img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
### Continued development
I plan to make this Order Summary reponsive by adding some Responsive Design principles like
- Media Queries
- CSS Units like rem amd em
once I learn them.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.scrimba.com) - This helped me to know better about CSS, particularly in centering a div vertically and horizontally. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.freedcodecamp.com) - This is   where I learned basics of HTML and CSS before undertaking Scrimba's Front End Career path. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concepts.
